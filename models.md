## How to navigate through models 
# Create an election
  You first must be logged in as superuser (see readme.md for how to create one)
  
  You need to input an election id in the format (YYYY-MM)
  
  The dropdown menu for selecting an election type only has three types: General, Primary, and Referendum
  
  Since our election id is a unique identifier, you can't have more than one type of election for a specific month.
